## Jumplinks v1 for ProcessWire

> Jumplinks 2, a complete rewrite, is in the works. Once an alpha-candidate is ready, the repo will be opened up for testing.

Jumplinks is an enhanced version of the original [ProcessRedirects](http://modules.processwire.com/modules/process-redirects/) by [Antti Peisa](https://twitter.com/apeisa).

The `Process` module manages your permanent and temporary redirects (we'll call these "jumplinks" from now on, unless in reference to redirects from another module), useful for when you're migrating over to ProcessWire from another system/platform.

Each jumplink supports [wildcards](https://jumplinks.rockett.pw/wildcards), shortening the time needed to create them.

Unlike similar modules for other platforms, wildcards in Jumplinks are much easier to work with, as Regular Expressions are not fully exposed. Instead, parameters wrapped in `{curly braces}` are used - these are described in the documentation.

As of version 1.5.0, Jumplinks requires at least ProcessWire 2.6.1 to run. At the time of writing this, version 3 on the development branch is also supported.
