# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing the Jumplinks for ProcessWire project.

As an open-source project, contributions are always welcome. Feel free to submit ideas and concerns over at the [official support thread](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/8697-jumplinks/). Note that support requests should also go there, and not in the repo issue tracker, which is **only** for reporting possible bugs and oversights, etc. Roadmaps are also posted in the issue tracker, but this may only be done by the project author (or team member, if applicable) for the purposes of tracking milestone progress.

## Issue Tracker

When submitting possible-bug reports to the issue tracker, please be sure to include as much information as possible. At the very least, be sure to post:

1. Your ProcessWire version
2. Your Jumplinks version
3. Your PHP version
4. Steps to reproduce the issue you're encountering
5. If the issue is UI/UX-related, please upload a screenshot

The following is optional:

1. Your MySQL version (provided the issue is database related)
2. Feel free to mention any suggestions you may have to fix the issue

> **Note:** If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email github@rockett.pw instead.

## Code Contributions

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

You are also welcome to submit pull requests to the master branch. It is preferred that you submit an issue first, but each case would have its own merits, and so the option to submit requests directly is always open.

When writing the code for your pull request, please be sure to follow these simple rules:

1. Indent using four spaces (tabs are cool, but they're not as cool as spaces - this isn't HTML, and so we don't need to compress anything).
2. Comment your code as much as you can - Jumplinks needs to be self-documented to a large degree. If your pull request changes a how a specific function or set of functions operates, then the [docs repo](/rockettpw/jumplinks-docs) would also need to be updated. You're welcome to submit a pull-request to the repo, but please be sure to use simple explanations in your documentation updates. If you're unsure, the project author or delegated team member (if applicable) will do this for you.
3. Be sure to use a docblock in any new functions you create.
